# I_want_a_flag
a wechat bot for adding a little flag to an image received via chatting  
AND send it back  

maybe just like this  

```text
+---+
|   |
|   |
+---+ <==== that is a little flag

+---------------------+
|                     |
|                     |
|                 +---+
|                 |   |
|                 |   |
|+----------------+---+ <==== here is the processed image
```

unluckily I have been blocked by wechat so I can not go online via web and test the bot
maybe it can work :-)
